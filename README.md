## Task One: APT breach: analysing the impact on information security

## Overview:
This task simulates a real-world scenario where I, as a cybersecurity professional, must investigate a cyberattack targeting a client. The objective is to analyze the attack, identify its root cause, assess its impact, and provide actionable recommendations to strengthen the client’s security posture.

## Steps Involved:

### Incident Analysis:

- Gather and analyze logs, network traffic, and any forensic evidence related to the cyberattack.
- Use tools like Wireshark, Splunk, or other SIEM platforms to detect anomalies and trace the attack's timeline.
### Attack Attribution:

- Determine the attacker's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) using frameworks such as MITRE ATT&CK.
- Attribute the attack to a specific threat group or motive (e.g., ransomware, data theft).
### Impact Assessment:

- Evaluate the damage caused by the attack, including compromised systems, stolen data, and operational downtime.
- Quantify the financial, reputational, and regulatory risks faced by the client.
### Documentation:

- Compile a detailed report outlining the findings, including:
    - <b> Summary: </b> High-level overview of the attack and its implications.
    - <b> Details: </b> Timeline, entry points, exploited vulnerabilities, and affected assets.
    - <b> Attackers: </b> Possible attribution based on TTPs and intelligence.
    - <b> Impact: </b> Detailed analysis of the consequences of the attack.
### Recommendations:

- Provide actionable steps to address gaps in the client’s security posture, such as:
   - Enhancing network segmentation.
   - Updating incident response plans.
   - Implementing threat detection and monitoring tools.
   - Conducting regular security awareness training for employees.

### Outcome:
By completing this task, I developed the ability to investigate cyberattacks systematically, analyze technical details, and communicate findings effectively to technical and non-technical stakeholders. This experience reflects the practical responsibilities of cybersecurity consultants and prepares me for addressing real-world cyber threats.
